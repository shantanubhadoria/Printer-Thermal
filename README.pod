=head1 NAME

Printer::Thermal - Interface for Thermal (and some dot-matrix and inkjet) Printers that support ESC/POS specification.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.12

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Printer::Thermal;
 
   #For Network Printers $port is 9100 in most cases but might differ depending on how you have configured your printer
   $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(device_ip=>$printer_ip,device_port=>$port);
 
   #These commands won't actually send anything to the printer but it will store all the merged data including control codes to send to printer in $printer->print_string variable.
   $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
   $printer->bold_on();
   $printer->write("Bold Text");
   $printer->bold_off();
   $printer->print(); ##Sends the above set of code to the printer. Clears the buffer text in module.
 
   #For local printer connected on serial port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
   my $path = '/dev/ttyACM0';
   $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path=$path);
   $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
   $printer->bold_on();
   $printer->write("Bold Text");
   $printer->bold_off();
   $printer->print();
 
   #For local printer connected on usb port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
   my $path = '/dev/usb/lp0';
   $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(usb_device_path=$path);
   $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
   $printer->bold_on();
   $printer->write("Bold Text");
   $printer->bold_off();
   $printer->print();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some might not find the module name accurate since ESCE<sol>P was developed initially for dot matrix and inkjet printers, however today most Thermal Receipt Printers use these codes for control. Most people(i.e. like me when I started looking for Thermal Printer stuff) who look for Thermal Printer codes don't know Thermal Printers use certain set of ESC codes to achieve a bunch of functions, and I didn't want to name it Printer::ESC::P because that would not help people who are new to receipt printers looking for something like this module. This module provides an Object oriented interface for interacting with Thermal Printers. Maybe I will refactor it later with subclasses. I used Moose and I apologize for that!! 

For ESCE<sol>P codes refer the guide from Epson http:E<sol>E<sol>support.epson.ruE<sol>uploadE<sol>library_fileE<sol>14E<sol>esc-p.pdf

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 usb_device_path

This variable contains the path for the printer device file when connected as a usb device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

=head2 serial_device_path

This variable contains the path for the printer device file when connected as a serial device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

=head2 device_ip

Contains the IP address of the device when its a network printer. The module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.

=head2 device_port

Contains the network port of the device when its a network printer. The module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.

=head2 baudrate

When used as a local serial device you can set the baudrate of the printer too. Default (38400) will usually work, but not always. 

This param may be specified when creating printer object to make sure it works properly.

$printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path => '/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate => 9600);

=head2 read_char_time

*DECRECATED*

=head2 read_const_time

*DECRECATED*

=head2 black_threshold 

Black ink threshold, This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default is 48.

=head2 alpha_threshold 

Alpha threshold, This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default is 127.

=head2 heatTime

Heating time to set for Supported Thermal Printers, this affects dot intensity.

This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default is 120

=head2 heatInterval

This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default is 50

=head2 heatingDots

This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default is 7

=head2 printer

This is the direct device handle to the printer, You must almost never use this.
Unless you are hacking through the module. If you are using this you must send me
a bug report on why you had to use this.

You can access it with $printer->printer

=head2 print_string

This contains the string in the module buffer that will be sent to the printer when you call $printer->print();

my $print_string = $printer->print_string

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $printer->print();

Sends the accumulated commands to the printer. All commands below need to be followed by a print() to send the data from buffer to the printer. You may call more than one printer command and then call print to send them all to printer together.
The following bunch of commands print a text to a printer, move down one line, and cut the receipt paper.

    $printer->write("hello Printer\n");
    $printer->linefeed();
    $printer->cutpaper();
    $pritner->print(); # Sends the all the commands before this to the printer in one go. 

=head2 $printer->write("some text\n");

Writes a bunch of text that you pass here to the module buffer. 
Note that this will not be passed to the printer till you call $printer->print()

=head2 $printer->left_margin($nl,$nh);

Sets the left margin code to the printer. takes two single byte parameters, $nl and $nh.
To determine the value of these two bytes, use the INT and MOD conventions. INT indicates the integer (or whole number) part of a number, while MOD indicates the
remainder of a division operation.
For example, to break the value 520 into two bytes, use the following two equations:
nH = INT 520/256
nL = MOD 520/256

=head2 $printer->reset()

Resets the printer 

=head2 $printer->right_side_character_spacing($spacing)

Takes a one byte number, spacing as a parameter

=head2 $printer->horiz_tab()
adds a horizontal tab character like a \t to the print string.

=head2 $printer->line_spacing($value)

Allows you to set the line spacing for the printer.

=head2 $printer->linefeed()

sends a new line character, i.e carriage return and line feed

=head2 $printer->justify($alignment)

$alignment can be either 'L','C' or 'R' for left center and right justified printing

=head2 $printer->bold_off();

=head2 $printer->bold_on();

=head2 $printer->doublestrike_off();

=head2 $printer->doublestrike_on();

=head2 $printer->emphasize_off();

=head2 $printer->emphasize_on();

=head2 $printer->font_size($n);

Defined Region
0 ≤ n ≤ 255
However, 1 ≤ vertical direction magnification ratio ≤ 8, 1 ≤ horizontal direction magnification ratio ≤ 8
Initial Value n=0
Function Specifies the character size (magnification ratio in the vertical and horizontal directions).

=head2 $printer->font_b();

=head2 $printer->font_a();

=head2 $printer->underline_off();

=head2 $printer->underline_on();

=head2 $printer->inverse_off();

=head2 $printer->inverse_on();

=head2 $printer->barcode_height($height);

=head2 $printer->print_barcode($type,$string)

=head2 $printer->print_text($msg,$chars_per_line);

Print some text defined by msg. If chars_per_line is defined, inserts newlines after the given amount. Use normal '\n' line breaks for empty lines.

=head2 $printer->color_1()

Prints in first color for dual color printers

=head2 $printer->color_2()

Prints in second color for dual color printers

=head2 $printer->cutpaper()

Cuts the paper. Most Thermal receipt printers support the facility to cut the receipt using this command once printing is done.

=head2 $printer->open_cash_drawer()

Opens the Cash Drawer connected to the thermal printer.

=head2 $printer->test()

Prints a bunch of test strings to see if your printer is working fine/connected properly. Don't worry if some things like emphasized and double strike looks the same, it happened with my printer too.

=head1 NOTES

=over

=item *

If the printer prints out garbled characters instead of proper text, try specifying the baudrate parameter when creating printer object when you create the printer object(not for network or USB printers)

=back

     $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path => '/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate => 9600);

=head1 USAGE

=over

=item *

This Module offers a object oriented interface to ESCE<sol>POS Printers. 

=item *

Create a printer object by providing parameters for one of the three types of 
printers supported.

=item *

then call formatting options or write() text to printer object in sequence. 

=item *

Then call the print() method to dispatch the sequences from the module buffer 
to the printer. 

=back

Note: While you may call print() after every single command code, this is not advisable as some printers tend to choke up if you send them too many commands too quickly.
