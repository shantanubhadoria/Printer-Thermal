=head1 NAME

Printer::Thermal - Interface for Thermal (and some dot-matrix and inkjet) Printers that support ESC/POS specification. Which as it happens, includes most receipt/kitchen printers in market.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Printer::Thermal;

  #For Network Printers $port is 9100 in most cases but might differ depending on how you have configured your printer
  $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(device_ip=>$printer_ip,device_port=>$port);

  #These commands won't actually send anything to the printer but it will store all the merged data including control codes to send to printer in $printer->print_string variable.
  $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
  $printer->bold_on();
  $printer->write("Bold Text");
  $printer->bold_off();
  $printer->print(); ##Sends the above set of code to the printer. Clears the buffer text in module.
  
  #For local printer connected on serial port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
  my $path = '/dev/ttyACM0';
  $printer2 = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path=$path);
  $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
  $printer->bold_on();
  $printer->write("Bold Text");
  $printer->bold_off();
  $printer->print();

  #For local printer connected on usb port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
  my $path = '/dev/usb/lp0';
  $printer2 = Printer::Thermal->new(usb_device_path=$path);
  $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
  $printer->bold_on();
  $printer->write("Bold Text");
  $printer->bold_off();
  $printer->print();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some might not find the module name accurate since ESC/P was developed initially for dot matrix and inkjet printers, however today most Thermal Receipt Printers use these codes for control. Most people(i.e. like me when I started looking for Thermal Printer stuff) who look for Thermal Printer codes don't know Thermal Printers use certain set of ESC codes to acheive a bunch of functions, so I didnt want to name it Printer::ESC::P. This module provides an Object oriented interface for interacting with Thermal Printers. Maybe I will refactor it later with subclasses. I used Moose, I apologize!! 
For ESC/P codes refer the guide from Epson http://support.epson.ru/upload/library_file/14/esc-p.pdf

=head1 METHODS 

=head3 $printer->usb_device_path

This variable contains the path for the printer device file when connected as a usb device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

=cut

has usb_device_path => (
  is => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',
);

=head3 $printer->serial_device_path

This variable contains the path for the printer device file when connected as a serial device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

=cut

has serial_device_path => (
  is => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',
);

=head3 $printer->device_ip

Contains the IP address of the device when its a network printer. The module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.

=cut

has device_ip => (
  is => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',

=head3 $printer->device_port

Contains the network port of the device when its a network printer. The module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer. This can be passed in the constructor.

=head3 $printer->baudrate

When used as a local serial device you can set the baudrate of the printer too. However default should usually work. let me know if it doesn't for you.

=head2 $printer->print();

Sends the accumulated commands to the printer. All commands below need to be followed by a print() to send the data from buffer to the printer. You may call more than one printer command and then call print to send them all to printer together.
The following bunch of commands print a text to a printer, move down one line, and cut the receipt paper.
  $printer->write("hello Printer\n");

  $printer->cutpaper();

=head2 $printer->left_margin($nl,$nh);

Sets the left margin code to the printer. takes two single byte parameters, $nl and $nh.
To determine the value of these two bytes, use the INT and MOD conventions. INT indicates the integer (or whole number) part of a number, while MOD indicates the
remainder of a division operation.
For example, to break the value 520 into two bytes, use the following two equations:
nH = INT 520/256
nL = MOD 520/256
